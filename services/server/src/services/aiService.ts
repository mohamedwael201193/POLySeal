    // EAS and Attestations
    'attestation': 'An attestation is a verifiable statement about something. In EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service), attestations are on-chain records that prove claims about entities, events, or relationships.',
    'eas': 'EAS (Ethereum Attestation Service) is a public infrastructure for making attestations on-chain or off-chain. It provides a universal layer for attestations on Ethereum and compatible chains like Polygon.',
    'schema': 'A schema in EAS defines the structure of attestation data. It specifies what fields are included in an attestation and their data types.',
    'polygon': 'Polygon is a Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. POLySeal runs on Polygon Amoy testnet, providing fast and low-cost attestations.',
    
    // POLySeal specific
    'polyseal': 'POLySeal is an AI-powered attestation platform built on Polygon using EAS. It helps create, verify, and manage attestations with intelligent assistance.',
    'pol token': 'POL is the native token of Polygon network, formerly known as MATIC. It is used for transaction fees and network security.',
    
    // Technical concepts
    'smart contract': 'Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with terms directly written into code. They run on blockchain networks like Ethereum and Polygon.',
    'blockchain': 'A blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions across many computers. It ensures transparency and security without a central authority.',
    'web3': 'Web3 represents the decentralized internet built on blockchain technology, where users own their data and digital assets.',
    
    // Practical help
    'create attestation': 'To create an attestation: 1) Connect your wallet, 2) Go to Create page, 3) Select a schema, 4) Fill in the data, 5) Submit the transaction.',
    'wallet connect': 'POLySeal supports Web3 wallets like MetaMask. Make sure you are on Polygon Amoy testnet (Chain ID: 80002).',
    'gas fees': 'Transaction fees on Polygon are very low, typically less than $0.01. Make sure you have some POL tokens for gas.',
